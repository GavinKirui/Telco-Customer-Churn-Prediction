# Telco-Customer-Churn-Prediction
Predicting the customer's chances of leaving a product.

Modeling Results: 
Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifiers were used as predictive models. Initial models show a reasonable predictive accuracy for churn but could improve with further tuning and feature engineering. Feature Importance: Some of the most influential features for predicting churn are contract type, tenure, monthly charges, and payment method. 

Evaluation Metrics: 
Model evaluation shows acceptable accuracy, though additional metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1 score) could provide a better understanding of the modelâ€™s ability to predict churn. Cross-validation could help confirm the model's robustness and reduce any potential overfitting observed in single-split evaluations.

Recommendations for Improvement:
To improve model accuracy, try advanced models like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting, and explore hyperparameter tuning. Consider additional EDA on interactions between demographic and account variables to capture more nuanced churn drivers.
